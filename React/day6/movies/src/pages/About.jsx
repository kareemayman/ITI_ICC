        This is a simple movie application built with React and Redux. It allows users to browse movies, view details, and manage their favorite movies.

      </p>
      <p>
        The application fetches movie data from an external API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can add movies to their favorites and view them separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
