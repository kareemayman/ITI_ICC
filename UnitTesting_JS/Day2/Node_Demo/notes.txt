âœ… Calls done() to tell the test runner that the async beforeAll is finished. Without this, tests might start too early.
ðŸ”§ done is a callback function used to signal that an asynchronous operation has finished.
If you donâ€™t call done(), tests may run too early (before data is ready), or time out.

ðŸ›‘ After all tests run, stop the server to clean up. This avoids issues like "port already in use" in future runs.

ðŸ“¦ What is the request Library?
The request library is a Node.js module used to make HTTP requests â€” similar to how a browser visits a website or fetches data from a server.

âœ… Main Purpose:
To send HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to a web server and receive responses.

ðŸ§  Why Use request?
In the context of testing, like in your Mocha or Jest tests:

It lets you act like a client (like a browser or mobile app).
You send a request to your server and check the response.
This helps verify that your API works as expected (status code, data sent back, etc).
